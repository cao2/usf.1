    <short-description>Layer link protocol of the IEEE-1394</short-description>
    <long-description>This is model of the "FireWire" high performance serial
    bus defined in the IEEE-1394 Standard. The bus involves n nodes
    (addressable entities that run their own part of the protocol) connected by
    a serial line. On each node the IEEE-1394 protocol consists of three stacke
    layers: the transaction layer, the link layer, and th physical layer. The
    protocol implemented by the link layer is designed to transmit data packets
    over an unreliable medium to a specific node or to all nodes (broadcast).
    The transmission can be performed synchronously or
    asynchronously.</long-description>

  <comment>In the source paper, the properties for this problem are expressed
  in action based temporal logic. In order to express these properties in state
  based formalism, it would be necessary to do some changes in the model.</comment>
