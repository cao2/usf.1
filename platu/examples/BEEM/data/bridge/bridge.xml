      <short-description>Puzzle about men crossing a bridge</short-description>    
    <long-description> Four men have to cross a bridge at night. The bridge is
  old and dilapidated and can hold at most two people at a time. There are no
  railings, and the men have only one flashlight. Any party who crosses, either
  one or two men, must carry the flashlight with them. The flashlight must be
  walked back and forth; it cannot be thrown, etc. Each man walks at a
  different speed. One takes 5 minute to cross, another 10 minutes, another 20,
  and the last 25 minutes. If two men cross together, they must walk at the
  slower man's pace. Can they get to the other side in 60 minutes? (The model
  is generalized to larger number of men.)
