  <short-description>Lego brick sorter</short-description>
  
  <long-description>The example is a model of a sorter of bricks built using a Lego
  Mindstorms systems. The Sorter  consists of the following parts:
 2 belts which are used to transport bricks, a light sensor which can detect passing bricks, an arm which can kick bricks from the belt, a button which is used to "order" bricks for processing.
The intended behaviour of the system is the following. Bricks are placed by
the user on the first belt. Bricks which are too long (length
is detected with the use of light sensor) are kicked out from the belt by the
arm. Short bricks are transported to the second belt. The second belt
transports them either to a "processing" side or to a "not-processing" side
depending on whether a brick has been ordered by pressing the button.
Although the system is rather simple and artificial, it has several features
typical for embedded systems. The model is discrete time.</long-description>
