    <short-description>Sam Lloyd's fifteen puzzle</short-description>
    <long-description>The "15 puzzle" is a sliding square puzzle introduced by Sam Lloyd in 1878.
It consists of 15 squares numbered from 1 to 15 which are placed in a box
leaving one position out of the 16 empty. The goal is to reposition the
squares from a given arbitrary starting arrangement by sliding them one
at a time into a configuration, where the squares are ordered by their
numbers. For more details see:
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/15Puzzle.html.

Because the 'fifteen' version has too big state space, we consider smaller
    instances as well. The goal, expressed by the reachability property below,
    is to reverse the order of pieces. </long-description>
