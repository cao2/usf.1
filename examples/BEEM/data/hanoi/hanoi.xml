    <short-description>Tower of Hanoi puzzle</short-description>
    <long-description>The Tower of Hanoi (sometimes referred to as the Tower of
    Brahma or the End of the World Puzzle) was invented by the French
    mathematician, Edouard Lucas, in 1883. He was inspired by a legend that
    tells of a Hindu temple where the pyramid puzzle might have been used for
    the mental discipline of young priests. Legend says that at the beginning
    of time the priests in the temple were given a stack of 64 gold disks, each
    one a little smaller than the one beneath it. Their assignment was to
    transfer the 64 disks from one of the three poles to another, with one
    important proviso that a large disk could never be placed on top of a
    smaller one. The priests worked very efficiently, day and night. When they
    finished their work, the myth said, the temple would crumble into dust and
    the world would vanish.</long-description>
